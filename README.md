# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is bias towards positive reviews when a reviewer is paid(Amazon vine member) when compared to a reviewer who isn't.
## Results
Paid Reviews (Amazon Vine)
-Total Reviews:94
-Number of 5-star reviews:48
-Percent of 5-star reviews:51.1%

Unpaid Reviews (Non-Amazon Vine)
-Total Reviews:40,471
-Number of 5-star reviews:15,663
-Percent of 5-star reviews:38.7%

## Summary
The conclusion I can draw from the data is that there is a bias for reviews in the Vine program with an over 10% rise in the frequency of 5-star reviews. Another analysis that I would like to perform on this data is if paid reviewers shy away from leaving poor reviews despite their actual views on a product.
